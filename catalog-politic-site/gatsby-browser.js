/**
 * Sets up i18n routing
 *
 * We hijack the popstate event from Gatsby's Reach Router and check if the
 * language part of the pathname changed. If it did, we use the i18n instance
 * to change the language accordingly. We only let the event to propagate
 * further to the router if anything else other than the language changeed in
 * the path.
 *
 * For example, if /en/parties changed to /ro/parties, we only changed the
 * language and stop the propagation immediately so the router doesn't get to
 * reload the page.
 *
 * If /en/parties becomes /en/politicians, we do not change the language, but
 * we let the event propagate to the router so it can load the next page
 * accordingly.
 *
 * If /en/parties becomes /ro/politicians, however, we change the language, but
 * we also let the event propagate to the router, so the end result is a double
 * action of changing both the page and the language.
